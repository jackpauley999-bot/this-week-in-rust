### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [zedbar](https://crates.io/crates/zedbar), a crate to read QR codes and a bunch of other barcode formats from images.

Thanks to [Brian Donovan](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1536) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

*No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen),
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen) or
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week we saw quite a few improvements. Largest one comes from adding two targeted `with_capacity` calls in [#151929](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/151929).
Another source of multiple improvements is the ongoing migration away from using external files to store diagnostic messages.

Triage done by **@panstromek**.
Revision range: [a60d12cb..39219ceb](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=a60d12cbccfbeaf153f3cecb90454aa696ea4b3b&end=39219ceb97d1b37dda72517daa9ebe8364ffe186&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> Unpopular opinion: error handling in Rust is actually fantastic. Once you know the right patterns, which regrettably are NOT always obvious 😂 

– [Ian Wagner on fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ianthetechie/116012332982905561)

Despite another week with a lamentable lack of suggestions, llogiq is pleased with what he found.
